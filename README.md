<strong>  </strong>The teaching assistants in CS 160 are very important to your success in the course. They are all competent and skilled in computer science, but they are all different in their specialties and chosen course. Record at least ten questions you have about OSU, computer science, life in Corvallis, internships, or research. Make sure your questions are appropriate and meaningful.  For example, a question about one’s personal views towards politics, religion, cultures, sexual orientation, etc. is not only inappropriate but also meaningless in the context of this class.  However, asking a TA their personal view on a class in the CS curriculum is just fine.

Think hard about these questions because you will ask your TA your top two questions next week.
